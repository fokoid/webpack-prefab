# Webpack Prefab

This npm module provides easy, readymade webpack configurations.

It is a work in progress and at present only two configurations are provided:
the [single][PrefabSingle] and [split][PrefabSplit] configurations from my
[webpack boilerplate repo][WebpackBoilerplateRepo].

The single configuration provides a barebones `webpack.common.js`. The split
configuration provides separate development and production configurations. For
more information see my [webpack configuration
tutorial][WebpackBoilerplateFromScratch].
